### Summary

- **Julia vs Opencv vs Numpy**
  <br>
  <br>
  As you can see, the winners of this benchmark where python's Opencv and Numpy (though the results varied based on the
  resolutions of the images, both had almost similar results).

  This doesn't mean that Julia is under performing compared to python, it's that both Python's Numpy and OpenCV are
  heavily optimized libraries specifically designed to perform such computationally expensive tasks. And julia was able
  to perform as close to Numpy in some tasks.

- **Julia loop vs Python loop**
  <br>
  <br>
  From this benchmark result, you can clearly see that Julia certainly performed 40x better than python
